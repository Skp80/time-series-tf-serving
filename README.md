# Seq2seq Model on Time-series Data: Training and Serving with TensorFlow

### Introduction

Seq2seq models are a class of Deep Learning models that have provided state-of-the-art solutions to language problems recently. They also perform very well on numerical, time-series data which is of particular interest in finance and IoT, among others. This repository contains two notebooks:

- Model development and optimization with TensorFlow (its low-level API);

- Serving the model with TensorFlow Serving and showing how to write a client to communicate with TF Serving over the network and use/plot the received predictions.

There is (or will be) a video of a presentation explaining the above code; check out the updates at [PatternedScience's LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/company/patterned-science/) to find the video.

### Conda Environments

- `requirements_training_node.txt`: env where the model is trained and exported;

- `requirements_client_node.txt` : env where the client runs and communicates with TF Serving (this env contains TensorFlow, but it does not need to have it, i.e., this is not the minimum-env that's required).

### Node hardware specs

- CPU node/worker (client) : 8 vCPUs, ~60GB RAM

- GPU node/worker (training): V100 GPU, 8 vCPUs, ~60GB RAM

This is where the above notebooks were run. The small mock dataset and the sine function that is learned in the notebooks do not, in fact, need GPU acceleration and need much less RAM.
